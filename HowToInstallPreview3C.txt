Update Preview3C

First Play out any Current Contracts you Might have loaded.  Important to not have any active Contracts.  If you fail to follow this advice you might lose your Archived Contracts.  This is not a 
huge deal, but can be annoying!

Delete your old MissionControllerEC folder!  Now that all saves are persistent you can safely Delete this folder when adding a new version. You can Now Set your config options in Game in the Settings GUI. Some 
settings will require a KSP restart though.  You can still just manually edit the config file if you wish.  

To Install just install the MissionControllerEC folder into you Kerbal Space Program GameData Folder.

When installing new version I highly suggest you do these steps to reset your contracts. 
1. Alt-F12
2. Select Contracts tab.
3. Select Tools.
4. Select Clear Current contracts.
5. This will wipe any old contracts and refresh the whole list.


ThatÅfs it!

Have fun.
