description = After the success of our Orbital Research Scanner, the need for a Ground based version that worked just as well as the orbital version had come.  Much smaller in size, this little science instrument packs a huge punch.  Able to scan a vast swath of land in hours.  And the ability to cook eggs has not diminished, in fact Engineers suggest that you could cook a whole barbeque on this baby.
