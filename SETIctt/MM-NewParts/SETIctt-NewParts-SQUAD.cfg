	description = A lack of political support and Kerbals with the right combination of stupidity and courage led to a search for alternative command methods. Our engineers are working on an android to fully replace Kerbals, however their "when it is done" mentality regarding a release date is not good enough for Gene. Thankfully one of our interns found an old computer on a flee market from which our electricians and mechanics created this elegant Probe Core.
