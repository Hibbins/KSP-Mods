Features Added:
FAR no longer throws jealous fits when Lazor System or MechJeb is onboard

All GUIs can be minimized; current implementation is placeholder for more flashy version


Wing "exposure" system updated to be less finagle-y and more aerodynamic based
Wing exposure calculated in editor to update CoL marker
Wing stall angle now based on geometry and "exposure" effects
Wing sweep now affects lift calculations and Mach effects
Wing parts with very high sweep now calculate "vortex lift" typical of delta wings

Overhaul of in-editor control surface GUI
Control surfaces move faster at 200 degrees/s (was ~80 degrees/s)
Control surface max deflection can be set in editor
Symmetry counterparts do not appear on the GUI anymore, since they get the same settings anyway
Added help window to in-editor GUI

Bugs Fixed:
Fixed an issue where NullReferenceExceptions were thrown during wing dismemberment

Known Issues:
Bogus control surface entries can appear in the editor GUI if a control surface is attached to another part that is in the heirarchy of an assembly being attached with symmetry.
Center of Lift indicator can make mistakes when parts are attached; CoL Update button added to control surface GUI as band-aid fix.


0.2v------------------------------------

Features Added:
Lift and drag values lowered to proper values based on units (were previously 10 times proper values)

Wing parts compatible with 0.17 Center of Lift editor function
Wing parts inherit stalls from parts in front of them
Wing parts given lower stall angle of attacks
Wing parts areas, spans, chords and aspect ratios adjusted to properly fit in-game models

Control surfaces can now be set in the editor; ability to do so in flight removed
Control surfaces can be set to act on multiple control axes
Control surfaces now take 1/4 second to fully deflect; this affects control as well as aesthetics

Flaps added (placeholder use of standard control surface model)
Flaps given 4 deflection settings; no deflection up to full deflection (currently 45 degrees)
Flaps take 3 seconds to move between deflection settings

"Flight Buddy" renamed to "FAR Flight Systems"
Wing Leveler moved to "FAR Flight Assistance Systems" window
Yaw Damper, Pitch Damper and Dynamic Control Systems added
Help function added for control systems

Added part.cfgs for original winglet parts

Bugs Fixed:
Fixed an issue with the Small Control Surface part where it would deflect the wrong direction
Fixed an issue that resulted in the wrong placement of the Aerodynamic Center (Center of Lift) that resulted in wrong wing exposure values

Known Issues:
NullReferenceExceptions are thrown during destruction of wing parts.  Doesn't seem to break anything, just makes crashes laggy like before 0.16.
Bogus control surface entries can appear in the editor GUI if a control surface is attached to another part that is in the heirarchy of an assembly being attached with symmetry.
Center of Lift indicator does not account for wing exposure


0.1v------------------------------------

Release
Lift goes with V^2
Drag of wings and otherwise nonfunctional parts (not engines, fueltanks, etc) doesn't go with mass
Drag accounts for parts attached to stack nodes
First pass of wing "exposure" system that finds nearby parts and adjusts lift and drag accordingly
Fixed infiniglide bug
Fixed no lift being generated from wings placed sideways
